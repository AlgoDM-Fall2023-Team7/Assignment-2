# Assignment-2

## Introduction

This project aims to leverage the power of Snowflake and machine learning to predict ad impressions and perform anomaly detection. 

### Part 1

#### a) Complete the Tutorial

To understand the foundational concepts and set up the Snowflake environment, follow the comprehensive tutorial provided by Snowflake: [Predict Ad Impressions with ML-Powered Analysis](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/predict_ad_impressions_with_ml_powered_analysis/index.html#0).

#### b) Build a Streamlit App

To interact with the data and explore two key use cases (forecasting and anomaly detection), we have created a Streamlit application. The Streamlit app allows you to visualize and analyze the data seamlessly.

Follow these steps to set up and run the Streamlit app:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
