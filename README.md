# Snowflake Machine Learning Project

This project consists of two parts, each involving the use of Snowflake and Streamlit to build and test various machine learning applications.

## Part 1

In this part, you will complete a tutorial and build a Streamlit app with two key use cases: forecasting and anomaly detection.

### Tutorial Completion
- Follow the tutorial: [Predict Ad Impressions with ML-Powered Analysis](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/predict_ad_impressions_with_ml_powered_analysis/index.html) and make sure to submit your work.

### Streamlit App Development
- Build a Streamlit app that allows you to interact with the data and perform two use cases: forecasting and anomaly detection.

## Part 2

This part involves testing three different machine learning applications that we discussed in class.

### Customer Lifetime Value Computation
- Implementation details can be found in the following resources:
  - [Medium Article Part 1](https://medium.com/snowflake/ml-on-snowflake-at-scale-with-snowpark-python-and-xgboost-c329c30c2feb)
  - [Medium Article Part 2](https://medium.com/snowflake/ml-on-snowflake-at-scale-with-snowpark-python-and-snowpark-ml-part-2-6491d72a9903)
  - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/snowpark-python-demos/tree/main/tpcds-customer-lifetime-value)

### Predict Customer Spend
- Implementation details can be found in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/snowpark-python-demos/tree/main/Predict%20Customer%20Spend)

### ROI Prediction
- Implementation details can be found in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/snowpark-python-demos/tree/main/Advertising-Spend-ROI-Prediction)

### Multipage Streamlit App
- Combine all three functions (Customer Lifetime Value Computation, Predict Customer Spend, and ROI Prediction) into a single Streamlit app with multiple pages.

## How to Run the Streamlit App
- Make sure to install the necessary dependencies for your Streamlit app. You can use `pip` to install them.
- Run the Streamlit app using the following command:
  ```bash
  streamlit run your_app_name.py
  ```
